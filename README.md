## Overview

The **Hotel Management System in Java** is a desktop application designed to simplify hotel billing processes. The application, developed using Java and Swing, provides a graphical interface that allows hotel staff to capture guest details, select services, and generate a comprehensive bill. The project is tailored to assist in real-time hotel management, reducing manual billing errors, and streamlining administrative tasks.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Bill Generation**: Automatically computes the bill based on guest inputs and selected options.
- **Interactive GUI**: Uses Java Swing components like labels, text fields, buttons, and combo boxes for an intuitive user experience.
- **Service Selection Options**: Allows selection of room types, duration of stay, and optional services through radio buttons and drop-down menus.
- **File Saving Capability**: Features a `JFileChooser` to save the generated bill in a text file format.
- **Print Option**: Enables printing of the final bill directly from the application.
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Implements basic form validation to ensure correct user input (e.g., checking for empty fields and valid email formats).

## Bill Generation Logic

The core functionality of the project is built around the generation of a detailed hotel bill. The process includes:

1. **Input Collection**: 
   - Guest Name
   - Phone Number
   - Email Address
   - Address (if applicable)
   - Room Type and Additional Options (like room service or extra facilities)
   - Duration of Stay

2. **Data Processing**: 
   - The application calculates the total bill based on the selected room type, stay duration, and additional services.
   - It handles validations to ensure all necessary fields are provided and correct.

3. **Bill Display**: 
   - The final bill is dynamically generated and displayed in a dedicated `JTextArea`.
   - The bill format includes all charges, applicable taxes, and a summary of the guest details.

4. **Actions on Bill**:
   - Save the bill to a file.
   - Print the bill for records.

---

## User Interface Components

The graphical user interface is designed using several key Swing components:

- **JLabel**: To display static text like titles and input field names.
- **JTextField**: For receiving user input (e.g., name, phone, email).
- **JTextArea**: Displays the generated bill in a formatted text block.
- **JRadioButton**: Allows users to choose between different room types and service options.
- **JComboBox**: Presents drop-down lists for selecting values such as the number of days of stay.
- **JButton**: Triggers key actions such as generating the bill, clearing inputs, saving to a file, and printing.

## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**: Ensure Java is installed on your system.
- **Development Environment**: Use an IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or run from a terminal using `javac` and `java`.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   Clone the repository with Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

   Or download and extract the ZIP archive.

2. **Compile the Project**

   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   javac Hotel.java
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   After successful compilation, start the application by executing:

   ```bash
   java Hotel
   ```

   The GUI should launch, presenting the hotel billing form.

## Code and Design Overview

### Class Structure

- **Main Class (Hotel.java)**:
  - Manages the initialization and display of the Swing GUI.
  - Contains event handlers for button clicks (e.g., generate bill, save, print).
  - Implements form validations and error handling to ensure data integrity.

### Event Handling

- **Action Listeners**: 
  - Each interactive component like buttons or radio selections is associated with an action listener.
  - These listeners capture user input events and trigger corresponding functions (e.g., computing the bill or clearing fields).

### Design Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - The code separates the UI logic from business logic as much as possible to simplify maintenance and scalability.
- **User Feedback**:
  - Immediate visual feedback is provided, both through dynamic updates to the UI and pop-up dialogs for errors or confirmations.

## User Guide

1. **Launching the Application**: Follow the instructions in the [Installation & Running](#installation--running) section.
2. **Filling Out Guest Information**:
   - Enter the guest’s name, phone number, and email.
   - Select the room type and duration of stay using the available radio buttons and combo boxes.
3. **Generating the Bill**:
   - Click on the "Generate Bill" button to process the information and view the bill in the text area.
4. **Saving and Printing**:
   - Use the "Save" button to open the file chooser and save the bill locally.
   - Click the "Print" button to print the displayed bill.
5. **Clearing Inputs**:
   - Use the "Clear" button to reset all fields and start with a new entry.

## Developer Guide

### Setting Up the Development Environment

- Ensure you have a working JDK installation.
- Use any Java IDE that supports Swing for ease of debugging and testing.
- Familiarize yourself with the Swing components used. The application leverages standard components and follows Java's event-driven programming model.

### Code Maintenance

- **Comments and Documentation**: 
  - The code contains inline comments to explain complex logic and event handling.
  - Further documentation can be added in `java.txt` or as Javadoc comments within the code.
- **Extending the Application**:
  - Future features, such as integration with a database or additional service options, should follow the established coding and UI design patterns.
  - Ensure that new functionalities are modular to maintain clean separation between UI and logic.

---

## Testing and Troubleshooting

### Testing the Application

- **Manual Testing**: 
  - Run the application and manually enter various test cases to ensure all input validations and calculations work as expected.
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - Check for empty fields and validate the format of email addresses and phone numbers.
- **Error Reporting**:
  - The application currently displays pop-up error dialogs for invalid input. Log these errors for further analysis if needed.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Compilation Errors**:
  - Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Java and that the classpath is correctly set.
- **UI Issues**:
  - Verify that all components are properly initialized and that Swing’s event dispatch thread is used correctly.
- **Runtime Exceptions**:
  - Use a debugger to step through the event listeners if unexpected behavior occurs during bill generation or file operations.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration**:
  - Implement a backend database (e.g., MySQL or SQLite) to store guest details and historical billing data.
- **Advanced Billing Options**:
  - Include additional services and customizable billing scenarios.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**:
  - Refine the layout and visual design, and consider migrating to JavaFX for a more modern look.
- **Multi-Language Support**:
  - Add support for multiple languages to cater to an international audience.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Develop unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the system.
